Due to the fact that I am currently sitting at a comfortable adjustable desk, writing this from a gaming desktop computer in Bellingham, WA I cannot give you the end result of this adventure but I can tell you that there are some particular obstacles and events which I look forward to. 
 
Upon researching for a place to stay I found that AirBnb had very reasonably priced rentals for about $150 a month. With my usual tendency to make sure I do the bare minimum of planning and research I immediately book it. With no reviews and a somewhat sketchy profile without verification I lay my trust in the airbnb technology gods to direct me towards a safe home in the Laureles district. 
 
Immediately I am sent back messages outlying that I “did not get approval.. Etc” in spanish, although I believe this was at their fault in not understanding how to use the AirBnb system. I clarify that I need one room and they approve my stay.

There were widespread protests in many larger cities including Cali, Bogota and Medellin. Looting occurred and the police response was likened to that of terrorist maneuvors and resulted in a number of deaths. As of the third of April, the number of active riots have decreased significantly and the president has rescinded the bill with promises of lessening its impact on the middle class. 

I believe it might be my dampened sense of friendship or reaching out from being overall - very solitary through the covid Pandemic, but the help I recieved from my AirBnb was on another level.
