While browsing through a list of Latin American countries I followed a trail of wikipedia links to a page that detailed the "Misery index". This measurement was created by Robert Barro, which he called the "Barro Misery index". 

What immediately caught was not only the fact that Venezuela was listed as number one, but far and away the most miserable country to grace this earth. See the list below.

This was hard to believe. Was venezuela truly 6.9 times as miserable as the next most miserable country - Zimbawbe? 

To further cement the vast difference in your head, here is a chart by statistica.

As I read down the wikipedia page, I found that the calculation of the World Misery was derived partially from Robert Barro's earlier findings, which find that a 1% point increase in the employment rate with roughly equates to a 1.7% increase in the inflation rate. This full calculation for the miserry index is the sum of inflation + unemployment plus the interest rate, plus (minus) the shortfall (surplus) between the actual and trend rate of GDP growth.

In a country where the minimum wage hovers around $20, or where it is currently illegal to publish the parallel exchange rate in order to contrast the epic inflation that has occured in the last decade. It is not surprising that it has exceeded in this index. A few years ago Bloomberg published a series of articles covering their "cafe con leche" index, which noted the  8,000,000% increase in the cost of a coffee with milk. 

I will leave you unconclusive but with a rather interesting article about one of the factors that greatly contributes to this kind of event [Stagflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation). An sitation where a country suffers from a prolonged period of slow economic growth and inflation.
