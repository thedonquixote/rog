Trust is a peculiar emotion I feel like I have expressed from a young age. Perhaps it is attributable to my fathers advise, which often came in the form of esotericism, a masters in Counseling and teachings from Buddhist background, or my mother's push for me to engage with a variety of activites.

Life has such an incredible breadth to it, with languages, personalities and ideologies continually spanning further than we thought imagined, it is often easy to introduce cynicism and fraternized thoughts to a situation in order to seperate yourself from the world view of another. However I would not say this would be the most beneficial. Over the few years I've had on this planet I've seen firsthand what purposefully disconnecting yourself from your environment can do to a man. 

It comes as no surprise that we often talk about connections, the necessity of meeting new people and building relationships as being a stepping stones towards a more purposeful life. But how often do you actually seek out those whose personality differs greatly from you. Without promise of monetary power how often would you reach out to someone purely because you find that they find their ideas important, to try and learn their perspective. The people whose ideas scare me or make me question my own - these are the kinds of people I place my trust in.
